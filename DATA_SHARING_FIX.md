# Data Sharing Fix - User Todo Lists

## Problem
You and your girlfriend could both log in and create todo items, and the data was showing in Firebase, but each user could only see their own data. The app was not showing shared data between users.

## Root Cause
The Firebase integration was storing data in separate user-specific documents:
- Each authenticated user had their own document in the `users` collection (e.g., `users/{user_id}`)
- Each user could only access their own document
- The app expected to see data for both users (`sun` and `ola`) in the same data structure

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Shared Document Structure
- Changed from individual user documents to a single shared document
- New structure: `shared-data/shared-reward-streaks`
- Both users now read from and write to the same Firebase document

### 2. Updated Firestore Service (`src/firebase/firestoreService.js`)
- Modified all functions to use the shared document ID instead of user-specific IDs
- Functions updated: `getUserData`, `saveUserData`, `updateUserData`, `listenToUserData`

### 3. Data Merging Logic (`src/utils/cloudStorage.js`)
- Added `mergeUserData` function to safely merge data without overwriting other user's information
- Enhanced sync logic to preserve both users' data when syncing
- Added migration function `migrateFromOldStructure` to move existing data

### 4. Real-time Synchronization
- Both users now listen to the same shared document
- Changes made by one user are immediately visible to the other user
- Real-time updates work for both users simultaneously

### 5. Data Migration
- Added automatic migration from old user-specific documents to shared structure
- Migration runs when users sign in
- Preserves all existing todo data and streaks

## How It Works Now

1. **Login**: Both users can log in with their Firebase accounts
2. **Shared Data**: All todo items, streaks, and rewards are stored in one shared document
3. **Real-time Updates**: When one user adds/completes a todo, the other user sees it immediately
4. **Data Safety**: Each user's data is preserved and merged safely
5. **Overview Page**: The "çž§çž§å¦³çš„" (Overview) page now shows both users' data correctly

## Privacy Features Maintained
- Private tasks (marked with ðŸ”’) are still only visible to the user who created them
- The privacy toggle in the todo creation form still works as expected

## What Changed in the Code

### Key Files Modified:
1. `src/firebase/firestoreService.js` - Updated to use shared document
2. `src/utils/cloudStorage.js` - Added data merging and migration logic
3. `src/App.js` - Added migration call on user authentication

### Database Structure:
**Before:**
```
users/
  â”œâ”€â”€ {user1_id}/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sun: { todos: {...}, streak: 5 }
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ola: { todos: {...}, streak: 3 }
  â””â”€â”€ {user2_id}/
      â”œâ”€â”€ sun: { todos: {...}, streak: 2 }
      â””â”€â”€ ola: { todos: {...}, streak: 7 }
```

**After:**
```
shared-data/
  â””â”€â”€ shared-reward-streaks/
      â”œâ”€â”€ sun: { todos: {...}, streak: 5 }
      â”œâ”€â”€ ola: { todos: {...}, streak: 7 }
      â””â”€â”€ lastUpdated: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
```

## Testing
1. Both users should log in with their Firebase accounts
2. Add todo items as one user - the other should see them in real-time
3. Check the Overview page to see both users' data
4. Verify private tasks are hidden from the other user

The fix is now complete and both users should be able to see each other's todo data in real-time!
